# docs-ui
Repository that provides the Antora UI and theme for the oNote documentation site.

This is a backup plan if there isn't time to implement reuse of Twig templates for the main oNote web site.

Antora UI theme uses Handlebars templates.

For more information, see https://docs.antora.org/antora-ui-default/.
